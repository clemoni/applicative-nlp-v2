    Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer
    science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between
    computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to
    process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. The result is a
    computer capable of "understanding" the contents of documents, including the
    contextual nuances of the language within them. The technology can then
    accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as
    well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.
